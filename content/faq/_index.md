# Why does this look like a pre built template?
Because it is. I made this website in markdown with
[hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). I am not a web designer. If you feel
you can do better, by all means go ahead.

# Why is your writing so hard to understand?
I am also not a writer. English is my worst class. If something doesn't make
sense, feel free to make an issue on
[github](https://github.com/padlock-xpl/padlock-xpl.org). If you think you can
explain something better, please make a pull request.

# How can I contribute?
At this stage of development, it's easier if I just write the code for it
myself, then once there's more of an established codebase, other developers can
start working on different parts of it. However, if you have any suggestions,
please let me know!

# Who develops this?
Currently, I am the only developer. My github is McFranko, and my email is
ellis@mcfranko.com
